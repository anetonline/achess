2. BASIC INSTALLATION

1. Place all files in a directory under /sbbs/xtrn/ (e.g., /sbbs/xtrn/achess/).

2. Set up the directory for users:
   - In SCFG, add a new External Program:
     - Name: A-NET ANSI Chess
     - Internal Code: ACHESS
     - Start-up Directory: /sbbs/xtrn/achess/
     - Command Line: ?achess.js
     - Access Requirements: (ANSI)

3. Required: Configure your local BBS Identity (For InterBBS)
   - Copy bbs.cfg.example to bbs.cfg in your achess directory.
   - Edit bbs.cfg with your node's information. Example:
   - * Remove or rename these files for NON-InterBBS use *
   
     [bbs]
     name = A-Net Online BBS
     address = 1:201/10
     bbs = aneto.synchro.net
     operator = StingRay
     
     [directories]
     inbound = /sbbs/fido/inbound/     (or where you choose)
     outbound = /sbbs/fido/outbound/   (or where you choose)
     
     [mailer]
     type = binkd
     poll_packets = true
     auto_process = true
   
   - This file is crucial for InterBBS play. Without it, your BBS may not be recognized
     correctly in InterBBS games, challenges, or score packets.



4. REGISTRATION INFO (reg.key)

To personalize the sign-off screen with your BBS name and Sysop name, edit the reg.key
file in your A-Net Chess directory:

Sysop=Your Name
BBS=Your BBS Name

Replace "Your Name" and "Your BBS Name" with your actual Sysop and BBS names.

If you do not edit this file, the sign-off screen will not display your personalized
BBS and Sysop information.



5. INTERBBS SETUP

a. Configure Your Node File

Edit chess_nodes.ini to list all participating BBSes:

[Node1]
name = A-Net Online BBS
address = 1:201/10
sysop = StingRay
location = Georgia, USA

[Node2]
name = Another BBS
address = 1:201/12
sysop = AnotherSysop
location = California, USA

Each node should use its FTN address or another unique identifier.

b. Configure Your Local BBS Identity

Edit bbs.cfg as described above.
This file tells the chess system who YOU are for InterBBS packets.

c. Scheduling InterBBS Packet Exchange

The InterBBS handler now runs as a standard Synchronet command, not with jsexec.

Commands:
- achess_ibbs.js validate # Check for issues 
- achess_ibbs.js cleanup # Fix duplicates 
- achess_ibbs.js distribute # (LC only) Send clean list
- achess_ibbs outbound   (create/send packets to all nodes)
- achess_ibbs inbound    (process incoming packets)
- achess_ibbs all        (run both inbound and outbound processing)
- achess_ibbs config     (display current configuration)
   - You can add the Sysop IBBS Command Menu in your External/Operator Menu
- See the achess_ibbs_screenshots.zip file with SCFG and operator menu screnenshots
  for timed events and Sysop menu setup.

- achess_ibbs scores     (display InterBBS scores)
- achess_ibbs games      (display active InterBBS games)
- achess_ibbs messages   (display InterBBS messages)
- achess_ibbs nodes      (display known nodes and players)
- achess_ibbs test       (create test packets with case variations)
- achess_ibbs menu       (run interactive menu)
- achess_ibbs reset      (*LC ONLY* to complete a League-Wide Reset, 				                    players/scores/messages/challenges/etc.)

Schedule these commands in your BBS event scheduler:
- Synchronet External Timed Events: Add timed events in SCFG

Example cron entries:
# Process InterBBS chess packets every 30-60 minutes
*or just a few times a day. ?achess_ibbs all

To move InterBBS packets for external mailers, use pmove.js:
- Move outbound: jsexec pmove.js outbound /path/to/binkp/outbox/
- Move inbound:  jsexec pmove.js inbound  /path/to/binkp/inbox/



6. NEW FEATURE: CASE-INSENSITIVE USERNAME MATCHING

The InterBBS system now supports case-insensitive username matching!

What this means:
- A challenge sent to "StingRay" will reach a user named "stingray" or "STINGRAY"
- Messages to "JOHN" will reach user "john" or "John"
- Score updates merge users with different cases ("Player1" = "player1")
- Works across any BBS regardless of username capitalization conventions

Benefits:
- No more missed challenges due to case differences
- Better compatibility between different BBS software
- Automatic case resolution with logging
- Preserves original case in display while matching logically

Testing case-insensitive matching:
1. Run: achess_ibbs test
2. Edit generated test files to use your username in different cases
3. Run: achess_ibbs inbound to process and see case resolution in action



7. IN-GAME INTERBBS FEATURES

- Users can send/receive InterBBS messages from within the chess game (menu options 7 & 8).
- Users can challenge, play, and respond to InterBBS Chess games via menu options 9, 10, and 11.
- Scores are automatically merged when you run the inbound processor.
- Messages and scores are exchanged as JSON packets.
- Users see a notification when they have new InterBBS messages upon entering the menu.
- NEW: All username matching is now case-insensitive for better compatibility.
- NEW: Enhanced notifications with proper case resolution.



8. SCORE FILES EXPLAINED

The game maintains three score files in the /sbbs/xtrn/achess directory:

1. scores.ans
- Purpose: Used by the chess game to display the high score list to players inside the game.
- Format: ANSI with Synchronet color codes (e.g., \x01h, \x01c).
- Note: Intended for in-game viewing, not for direct BBS bulletins.

2. scores.asc
- Purpose: Provides a plain ASCII (no color) version of the high score list.
- Format: Simple text, readable in any editor.
- Note: Useful as a fallback or for non-ANSI displays.

3. score.ans
- Purpose: Generated automatically for sysops to use as a working ANSI bulletin.
- Format: Standard ANSI escape codes; compatible with all BBS software and terminals that support ANSI.
- How It's Made: The game converts scores.ans (Synchronet codes) into score.ans using real ANSI sequences.
- Use as Bulletin: Set score.ans as a BBS bulletin to show the high scores in full color to your users.

Summary Table:

File         | Color Codes    | Intended For          | Use as Bulletin?
-------------|----------------|-----------------------|------------------
scores.ans   | Synchronet     | In-game display       | No
scores.asc   | None (ASCII)   | Simple text viewing   | Possible
score.ans    | Real ANSI      | BBS bulletins, users  | Yes

Tip:
If you want to display the color high score list as a BBS bulletin, always use score.ans (not scores.ans).



9. TROUBLESHOOTING & TIPS

- Make sure your directories have the correct permissions.
- If you add new BBSes, update chess_nodes.ini and distribute it to all participating systems.
- Use pmove.js if your mailer drops files in a different directory.
- All files are plain text/JSON and can be safely inspected for debugging.
- If InterBBS features do not work, double-check your bbs.cfg and chess_nodes.ini for accuracy!
- Always test InterBBS features with at least two BBSes before announcing a tournament.

NEW: Case-Insensitive Troubleshooting:
- Check /sbbs/xtrn/achess/interbbs.log for case resolution messages
- Use achess_ibbs test to create test packets with various case combinations
- If challenges aren't reaching users, verify the target username exists locally
- Case differences are automatically logged when resolved
- Use achess_ibbs config to verify your BBS identity and directories

Command Troubleshooting:
- If achess_ibbs commands don't work, ensure the script is in /sbbs/xtrn/achess/
- Check that Synchronet can execute the script (permissions)
- Use achess_ibbs menu for interactive testing
- Verify your bbs.cfg configuration with achess_ibbs config



10. ADVANCED FEATURES

Interactive Menu System:
Run achess_ibbs menu for a full interactive interface with:
- Real-time packet processing
- Live score viewing
- Game and message management
- Test challenge sending
- Configuration viewing

Automated Scheduling:
For busy networks, consider running:
- achess_ibbs.js inbound - every 15 minutes  (for you to determine)
- achess_ibbs.js outbound - every hour       (for you to determine)
- achess_ibbs.js all - 4 * per day           (for you to determine)
* See attached screenshots for Timed Events Setup in SCFG)

Player Database:
The system automatically maintains:
- Player lists per BBS node
- Last seen dates
- Game statistics
- Case-insensitive username mapping

Use ?achess_ibbs.js nodes - to view all known players and nodes.

12. LEAGUE COORDINATOR (LC) FEATURES

The AChess InterBBS system designates one BBS as the League Coordinator (LC), which has special administrative capabilities for managing the InterBBS Chess League. These features are only available to the designated LC.

Setting Up the League Coordinator:
- The LC is determined by the BBS address in your bbs.cfg
- By default, Node1 in the chess_nodes.ini file is considered the LC
- You can specify a custom LC address with this line in bbs.cfg:

Running achess_ibbs.js menu  os still the Best option for running commands as an LC or NON-LC. The menu option can be placed in your operator menu in external programs.


LC-Only Commands:
- `achess_ibbs.js distribute` - Send the clean node list to all BBSes
- `achess_ibbs.js reset` - Perform a league-wide reset (clears scores, games, etc.)
- Master Node List Management (via interactive menu):
- Create/Update master node list
- Add new nodes to master list
- Edit existing nodes in master list
- Remove nodes from master list
- Validate all nodes against master list
- Distribute master node list

Master JSON Node List:
- File: lc_master_nodes.json
- Purpose: Provides the definitive list of authorized nodes in the league
- Only the LC can create and modify this file
- Contains full details of all nodes including:
- BBS name
- Address
- SysOp name
- Location
- Last seen timestamp
- This file is used for:
- Validating node registrations
- Cleaning up duplicate/conflicting nodes
- Authorizing new nodes to join the league
- Resolving address conflicts

Using the Master Node List Management Menu:
1. As the LC, run: `achess_ibbs.js menu`
2. Select option M for "Manage master node list"
3. Choose from the following options:
 1. Create/Update master node list from current nodes
 2. Add new node to master list
 3. Edit existing node in master list
 4. Remove node from master list
 5. Validate all nodes against master list
 6. Distribute master node list to all nodes

Node Management Workflow for League Coordinator:
1. New BBS wants to join the league
2. LC adds them to the master list using option 2
3. LC distributes updated list using option 6
4. All BBSes receive the node registry update
5. New BBS can now participate in InterBBS chess games

Benefits of the Master Node List:
- Prevents unauthorized BBSes from joining the league
- Ensures consistency across all participating BBSes
- Simplifies management of network changes
- Provides one authoritative source for node information
- Helps resolve conflicts when BBSes have different node information

Important Notes:
- Only the LC should modify the master node list
- After making changes, always distribute the updated list
- Regular validation helps keep the network clean
- The master JSON format allows for future expansion
- LC status is verified for all administrative commands

League-Wide Reset Feature:
- Allows the LC to reset the entire league (scores, games, messages)
- Requires double confirmation to prevent accidental resets
- Each BBS will acknowledge the reset when processed
- Can selectively reset different components (scores, games, etc.)
- Automatically notifies all users of the reset
